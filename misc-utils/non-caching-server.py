# Description of modifications by NRC
# - Eddie Antonio Santos, 2021: extract the minimum http server code and modify
#   it to disable client-side caching by systematically adding the header
#       Cache-Control: no-store, max-age=0
#   to all requests.
#   This is to work around an issue on Mac computers where sometimes even a hard
#   refresh will not fetch manually updated pages.
#
#   Running this script in a root web site folder is equivalent to running
#       python3 -m http.server
#   in that folder, except that pages won't get cached.
#
# - Eric Joanis, 2021:
#   - document the license and modification history of this script.
#   - reformat with black and isort, and quiet flake8 warnings, so I can pass CI
#     in the ReadAlongs/Studio repo.
